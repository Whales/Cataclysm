The game has two new major mechanics: weather and an XP pool.

Weather is a set of gameplay effects and is updated on the half-
hour.  Most notably, rain can get you wet, hurting your morale
(and possibly your equipment in the future), sun can cause glare
that reduces perception (wear a baseball cap!) and acid rain is
almost as bad as a spitter zombie.  Seek cover!

The XP pool is very similar to the one in crawl; it's a set of
points which are used to increase your skills.  Unlike crawl,
and pretty much any other game, it's filled by having high
morale.  This makes tasty food, engaging books, and drugs all
very valuable!  I'm not sure about this mechanic, and haven't
tested it thoroughly, but I'm giving it a try.  Let me know what
you think!
