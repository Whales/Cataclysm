Cataclysm now features a Message Of The Day.  Watch this space
for news of the latest features, gameplay tips, and other items
of note.  This feature is mainly useful for those who play on,
or operate, an SSH cataclysm server; if you wish to display a
message on your home copy, simply add a file called "motd" in
the "data" directory.
